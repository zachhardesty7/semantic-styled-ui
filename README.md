Leveraging the power and style of Semantic UI and Styled Components to deploy custom components that
abstract away complex library interactions.

## Description

This repo hosts a UI component library for React that styles content based of Semantic UI but
improves the default styles with Styled Components. It allows for easy plug and play in projects
looking to take advantage of Styled Components without dealing with the hassle of integrating
Semantic UI styles manually. It also includes some useful components and prebuilt components for
rapid web app development.

Library originally built for [connect-door] and then copied into
[gulf-corp] for further development. Commits here only go back to
the beginning of the second repo so visit the first for more commit history.
